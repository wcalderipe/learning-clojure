; The following example shows how you could use this capability if you were a vampire trying
; to curb your human consumption. You have two vectors, one representing human intake in liters
; and another representing critter intake for the past four days. The unify-diet-data function
; takes a single dayâ€™s data for both human and critter feeding and unifies the two into a single map
(def human-consumption [8.1 7.3 6.6])
(def critter-consumption [0.0 0.2 0.3])
